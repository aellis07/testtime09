In this repo I make a interactive quiz with a set timer.

The technologies used in this homework were as follows:
HTML
CSS
Javascript

The requirements were:
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

The main challenges I faced with this homework were:

1. Stopping the timer when the user reached the end of the quiz.
2. Usig quiz time as form of keeping score.
3. Getting the local storage to display on the webpage.
